          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            The Frailty Detection System is designed to assist healthcare professionals in 
            identifying and managing frailty in elderly patients. Our mission is to provide 
            doctors with advanced tools to improve patient outcomes through early detection 
            and comprehensive assessment.

          <h2>What is Frailty?</h2>
          <p>
            Frailty is a clinical syndrome characterized by decreased reserve and resistance 
            to stressors, resulting from cumulative decline across multiple physiological 
            systems. It increases vulnerability to adverse health outcomes including falls, 
            hospitalization, disability, and mortality.

          <h2>Our Technology</h2>
          <p>
            Our system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze multiple health 
            parameters including:
          </p>
          <ul className="feature-list">
            <li>Physical measurements and vital signs</li>
            <li>Cognitive and mobility assessments</li>
            <li>Medical history and current medications</li>
            <li>Lifestyle factors and social support</li>
            <li>Functional independence levels</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By analyzing these comprehensive data points, our system provides accurate 
            frailty risk assessments to help doctors make informed clinical decisions.
